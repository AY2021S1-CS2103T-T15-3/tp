## Project: Warenager

Warenager is an **inventory application** to help tech-savvy warehouse managers to keep track of items in their warehouse.
It **optimizes management tasks** for warehouse managers including but not exhaustive of updating,
searching and ordering supplies, via Command Line Interface (CLI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to delete existing stock from the inventory.
  * What it does: Allows the user to delete the chosen stock.
  * Justification: This feature enables the user to delete any unwanted or unused stock, so that
    the storage will not be clogged up with outdated stock.

* **Reviews & Merging**:
  * Ensured code quality when reviewing pull requests, before approving merge.

* **Project management**:
  * Ensured team meetings cover the requirements for the week.

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Converted the draft user guide content to markdown file format.
    * Updated the documentation for `delete` feature.
  * Developer Guide:
    * Update NFR and Appendix section for Warenager.
    * Added implementation details of the `delete` feature.
