## Project: Warenager

Warenager is an **inventory application** to help tech-savvy warehouse managers to keep track of items in their warehouse.
It **optimizes management tasks** for warehouse managers including but not exhaustive of updating,
searching and ordering supplies, via Command Line Interface (CLI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to update existing items in the storage.
  * What it does: Allows the user to update the details of the desired stock.
  * Justification: This feature improves the user experience as user can easily edit the details of
  existing items. Users now do not need to remove the item and then add them back in order to
  edit the details.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future.
   It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.
   The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
