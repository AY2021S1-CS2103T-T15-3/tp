## Project: Warenager

Warenager is an **inventory application** to help tech-savvy warehouse managers to keep track of items in their warehouse.
It **optimizes management tasks** for warehouse managers including but not exhaustive of updating,
searching and ordering supplies, via Command Line Interface (CLI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to find existing items in the storage.
  * What it does: Allows the user to search for desired stock.
  * Justification: This feature improves the user experience as user can easily search for the details of
  existing items. Users can now search for their desired stocks quickly and conveniently,
  by using any of the fields (name, serial number, location stored, source of stock) to find
  their desired stock. Users have the convenience of searching for a whole list of stocks that are related,
  instead of only being able to search for one stock (via name).
  * Highlights: This enhancement comes with the ability to find stocks from not just the name of the stock
  but also other related fields such as serial number, location stored and source of stock.
  Search is also case-insensitive and any stock that contains the search term will be shown.

* **Git & Repository**:
  * Used GitHub Projects feature to create kanban boards to track user stories.

* **Reviews & Merging**:
  * Helped to review pull requests.
  * Helped to merge approved pull requests after thorough review and GitHub action checks.

* **Documentation**:
  * Responsible for managing documentation quality and content.
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the feature `find`.
    * Checked team members' documentation.
  * Developer Guide:
    * Added documentation for the feature `find`.
    * Added use cases for feature `find`.
    * Added documentation for `non-functional requirements` and `glossary`sections.
    * Checked team members' documentation.
